A demo project using [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/)

## Project setup

1. Clone repository to your local machine

2. Create an `.env` file in the root directory based on the example:

```
cp .env.example .env
```


3. [Generate an Open Weather Map API key](https://openweathermap.org/appid) on their website and include it in your `.env` file - the app will not run without it.
